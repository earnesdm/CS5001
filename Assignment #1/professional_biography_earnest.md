- Machine Learning
## Project Sought
 - applying Reinforcement Learning to achieve human or super-human performances in video games (probably something from Nintendo)
 - examining if there are benefits to using a "Foundation Model" and fine-tuning approach in Reinforcement Learning (similar to BERT in NLP). This would probably use the Atari Gym environments. 
 - any project other with a substantial Reinforcement Learning or Deep Learning component
