- As a researcher, I want to understand the ability of reinforcement learning agents to learn video games, so that I can improve my knowledge of reinforcement learning.
- As a gamer, I want to explore how deep reinforcement learning agents would compare to the typical hard-code AIs which we see in video games, so that I can know how much performance game developers are lossing out on.
- As a fan of emulation, I want to explore how emulators can help train reinforcement learning agents, so that I can better understand emulation.
- As a researcher, I want practice implementing reinforcement learning approaches, so that I can be more affective in my future jobs and studies.
